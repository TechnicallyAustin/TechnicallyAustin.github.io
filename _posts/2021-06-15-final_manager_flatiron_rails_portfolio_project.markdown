## The Idea
For my Rails portfolio project, I built a task manager that organizes tasks Based on the group they are associated with and the Task lists that they belong to. 

When initially starting my project, I wanted to build a content management system that connected to Spotify to use their data within my app. However, as I worked on my project it just continued to balloon and at some point, became utterly broken. Instead of debugging the mess of code that I had created, I just felt it would be easier to start over with an idea that was a bit less complex. I ended up starting over four times.

While this was extremely frustrating It was also incredibly helpful, every time I started a new project with a different idea, I would build out basic features until I got to the more complex issues and gave up hope. As I went through my trial by fire things began to make more sense and became much less mystical. Even though I was met with obstacles along the road, I really just need one breakthrough to gain moment and build out my project. The key was simplicity, focusing on one issue at a time and Ruby Gems.

## Gems
Probably the greatest help for me in the is project was the use of Gems.

I am the type of person who loves to learn and figure things out on my own, while this is a trait about myself, I really admire it is also a problem.

I spent so much time on this project trying to build and implement features that I could achieve using a Gem. I spent a regrettable amount of time trying to figure out user Authorization using Bcrypt, before stumbling onto Devise. Not that Bcrypt is a bad Gem, there just happened to be a better tool to accomplish what I needed.

## Conclusion

More than anything this project was really a test of my programming ability. And while I may have run into many hardships it was an educational experience. As most of the projects have gone, I feel significantly my Developer like after completing it. I just hope I can find the same amount of success in a limited time with JavaScript.
