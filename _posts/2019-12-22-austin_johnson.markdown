### Portland OR
### Oregon State Alumni

Hey all my name's Austin and I’m currently located in Portland Oregon. I'll be honest I’m not Crazy about it here but it what it is.

As long as I can remember I have been interested in all things technology and as I’ve grown, I’ve done what I can to develop those interests as well. Previously my area of expertise was more based in support but over the last few years I’ve been trying to expose myself to as many new ideas and technologies as I can.

When I was still in school, I was an athlete, so I didn't have the greatest opportunity to follow my passion in engineering and technology. At that time, I had to pick, and I picked sports.

I ended up breaking my foot and retiring from football but that was just the opportunity I needed to start following my technical passions I started working at Oregon State’s IT Help Desk and progress my skills and understanding from there.

My projects led me to eventually wanting to build a drone. At first, I thought it would be simple, but I soon realized it was a larger task than originally expected. 

I had 0 skills with a soldering iron and honestly, I have pretty big hands to the tiny contact patches were a lot of trouble.  I eventually got most things together but made some mistakes and fried everything,


The main component in my drone building was programming it to perform autonomous tasks and eventually add features using Arduinos’, Raspberry Pi’s and sensors. I lacked the knowledge to do these things and I still do but I figured that strengthening my knowledge in software engineering I can get closer to where I want to be ability wise. 

And also, if not obvious. I want to make tons of money.
